<p>Although  we were unable to organize a traditional social event treasured by all LIDA  participants as one of the highlights of the conference, we invite you to join  us in a virtual gathering to celebrate healthy living, reading awareness, and  the planning for LIDA 2023 in Osijek. In this activity, we invite LIDA  participants to join a traditional dyslexia awareness-raising campaign  organized by Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Osijek in support of  to the National Campaign  for Persons with Reading Difficulties and Dyslexia &bdquo;I Wish to Read Too!&ldquo; of the  Croatian Library Association (CLA). LIDA 2023 will take place in  Osijek, Croatia. <br>
  All LIDA participants are invited to take part in this first virtual race.  All you have to do is walk, run or ride a bike from Friday through Sunday this  week (23 â€“ 25 April 2021). There is no minimum distance, and you can do as many  kilometers/miles as you want. After the activity, send us a screenshot of your  activity (recorded in any application, such as Sports Tracker (free), Strava  etc.) with indication of your name, type of activity, and number of km/ml. You  are also encouraged to send us a photo/selfie of your activity. If you happen  to pass by a library while walking, running or riding a bike, you can take a photo  and send it along.<br>
  All screenshots and photos should be emailed to <a href="mailto:lida@ffos.hr">lida@ffos.hr</a> by Monday 26 April 2021. You will be entered  in a draw and the winning participant will be awarded free registration for  LIDA 2023.<br>
  Have fun!</p>
