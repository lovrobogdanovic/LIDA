<p>Abstract:<br />
Digital library technology and digital systems supporting archives  of structured text had a major impact on the humanities scholarship of the past  decade yet this effect is not fully understood. The main objective of this  study is to understand the practices of scholarship and the rhetoric of  disciplinary identity connected to digital systems as new mode of  communication. To understand the effects (and identify the perceived<br />
effects) of the digital libraries on the humanities scholarship,  this paper will analyze data from an informal web survey, personal  communication with developers of key projects, published documentation of  exemplary projects, and literature on digital humanities and information  science field. Crucial concerns related to the digital systems and digital  archives will be identified and discussed. Moreover, the paper will present a  brief survey of relevant literature &ndash; from work on electronic text in the  humanities from the late 1980s to media ecology field &ndash; as a context in which the  disciplinary rhetoric of digital humanities is evolving today. </p>
