<p><strong><a name="sompel" id="sompel"></a>Herbert Van de Sompel, Ph.D.</strong> (Lead of the Digital Library Research and Prototyping Team, Los Alamos  National Laboratory)<br />
  <br />
  Herbert Van de Sompel graduated in  Mathematics and Computer Science at Ghent University (Belgium), and in 2000  obtained a Ph.D. in Communication Science there. For many years, he headed  Library Automation at Ghent University. After leaving Ghent in 2000, he was  Visiting Professor in Computer Science at Cornell University, and Director of  e-Strategy and Programmes at the British Library. <br />
Currently, he is the team leader of the  Prototyping Team at the Research Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The Team does research regarding various aspects of scholarly communication in  the digital age, including information infrastructure, interoperability,  digital preservation and indicators for the assessment of the quality of units  of scholarly communication. Herbert has played a major role in creating the  Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH), the Open  Archives Initiative Object Reuse &amp; Exchange specifications (OAI-ORE), the  OpenURL Framework for Context-Sensitive Services, the SFX linking server, the  bX scholarly recommender service, and info URI. Currently, he works with his  team on the <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/">Open</a><a href="http://www.openannotation.org/">Annotation</a> and <a href="http://www.mementoweb.org/">Memento</a> (time travel for the Web) projects.</p>

<strong><a name="goodman" id="sompel2"></a></strong><strong>Alyssa Goodman, Ph.D. </strong>(Professor  of Astronomy, Harvard University)</p>
<p>Alyssa Goodman is <em>Professor of Astronomy</em> at Harvard University, and a Research Associate of the Smithsonian Institution.  Goodman and her research group at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for  Astrophysics in Cambridge, MA study the dense gas between the stars. They are  particularly interested in <em>how this interstellar gas arranges itself into  new stars</em>. Their investigations use a variety of observational techniques  covering the spectral range from X- ray to radio.<br />
  Goodman is <em>P.I. of The COMPLETE Survey  of Star-Forming Regions</em>, which, in 2006, finished mapping out three very large  star-forming regions in our Galaxy in their entirety. These three regions were  also fully observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope, under the c2d  &quot;Legacy&quot; Program, in 2004-5. The COMPLETE Survey represents a data  set of unparalleled diversity and is of order one thousand times larger than  what was available a decade ago. The database is allowing astrophysicists to  address questions like <em>how many stars like the Sun can form from a given  mass of gas in the Milky Way</em>?<br />
  Goodman also has a strong interest in scientific  computing. She co-founded <em>The Initiative in Innovative Computing (IIC)</em> at Harvard, and she served as its Director from 2005-8. The IIC is a  multi-disciplinary center that fosters <em>new work at the boundary between  computing and science</em>. Goodman's own research in the this area focuses on  new ways to visualize and analyze the tremendous data volumes created by  surveys like COMPLETE. Presently, she is working closely with colleagues at  Microsoft Research, helping to expand the use of the <em>WorldWide Telescope</em> program.<br />
  Goodman also teaches several <em>courses</em> at Harvard, on both astrophysics and on the display of data, including one  called <em>The Art of Numbers.</em><br />
Goodman received her undergraduate degree  in Physics from MIT in 1984 and a Ph.D. in Physics from Harvard in 1989. She  held a President's Fellowship at the University of California at Berkeley from  1989-92, after which she took up a post as Assistant Professor of Astronomy at  Harvard. In 1997, she received the Newton Lacy Pierce Prize from the American Astronomical  Society for her work on interstellar matter and became full professor at  Harvard in 1999. She currently serves as Chair of the Astronomy Section of the  American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
