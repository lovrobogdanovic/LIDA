<p><strong>Introduction </strong> <br />
All submissions must be submitted electronically via the conference  submission web page <a href="http://web.ffos.hr/lida/upload/">http://web.ffos.hr/lida/upload/</a>.  Submissions will be accepted in Word and RTF (Rich Text Format) format. </p>
<p><strong>General Layout and Formatting </strong> <br />
  Refereed paper length is limited to 16 pages (including all figures,  tables, bibliography and appendices). Posters, workshops and panel summaries  should be 2 - 3 pages in length. Additional layout guidelines as follows: <br />
  <br />
  Formatted for A4 paper (8.5 x 11   inch paper). <br />
  Margins set to 25 mm  (1&rdquo;). <br />
  1,5-space between paragraphs, sections, and subsequent sections.  Single-space paragraphs. <br />
  Single-column. Flush left.<br />
  Font face shall be Arial, 11 point size. <br />
  Titles shall be 14 point size, bold.<br />
  Subtitles shall be 12 point size, bold.<br />
  Style &ndash; use <em>italics</em> as little as  possible (e.g. for titles of books, periodicals, and microfilm publications; anchors  of a scale [e.g. 1 (<em>poor</em>) to 5 (<em>excellent</em>)]; use bold for title of sections  and subsections.<br />
  &nbsp; <br />
  <strong>Submission Style </strong> <br />
  For papers reporting on research, the background and purpose of the study  should be stated first, followed by details of the methods, materials,  procedures, and equipment used. Findings, discussion and conclusions should  follow in that order. Appendices may be employed where appropriate. For papers  reporting on best practices or other aspects of information science, the  authors should strive for a structure that will be clear to their intended  audience. </p>
<p><strong>Submission Layout </strong></p>
<p>Submission should begin with the title of the submission and the authors&rsquo;  names, affiliations, and email addresses, as described and illustrated below. Use Author Notes  only to supplement basic author information such as institution, addresses, and  other contact information. Supplemental information includes disclaimers,  notice of perceived conflicts of interest, and acknowledgements identifying  grants and other sources of funding. Author Notes is also the proper place to  acknowledge contributions from earlier studies, a doctoral dissertation, or a  paper presented at a meeting. For other purposes endnotes should be  used. <br />
  An informative abstract of 200 words or less must be included on the first  page, followed by a maximum of 5 key word phrases. <br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
  There is no need to insert a page break after the abstract; continue with  Introduction, sections, sub-sections, etc., text, tables, figures, equations,  etc. as illustrated below: </p>
<p><strong>Subsequent Pages Sections </strong> <br />
  Sections should be numbered hierarchically, starting from the Introduction,  in the following manner 1.0., 1.1., 1.1.1., etc.). Double-space between  paragraphs, sections, and subsequent sections </p>
<p><strong>Instructions for Tables, Figures, Equations, and other  visuals </strong> <br />
  General instructions:&nbsp; Embed Tables,  Figures, Equations, and other visuals in the desired positions in the document.  Insert tables using your word-processor&rsquo;s native table layout functionality and  features. Position table caption above the table and center both relative to  the page, not the section. Number tables sequentially in series and separately  from other graphics (e.g. Table 1., Table 2., etc.). Position caption below the  figure or graph and center both relative to the page (e.g. Figure 1., Figure  2., etc.).</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Title (bold, centered, Arial 14 point  size)</strong> <br />
  First Author Name, Family Name &nbsp;(centered, Arial 12 point size) <br />
