<p>Short description: <br />
  The organizers of this workshop are development  consultants at Aalborg   University
  Library, Aalborg    University, Denmark.  Having different backgrounds, educations and
  profiles, they will present different aspects of  multimedia development, implementation
  and deployment. They have been working with  E-learning and multimedia development
  since 1999.<br />
  The workshop proposes to engage participants in  reflection and discussions about choices
  of pedagogy in e-learning and blended learning  environments. Participants will be
  actively engaged in the learning process in the  workshop and they will enter in a dialogue<br />
  with the other participants and the organizers.<br />
  Our point of departure is the development,  implementation and deployment of an
  innovative e-learning program/multimedia system;  SWIM (Streaming Webbased
  Information Modules). This is a case study of  how an organization has changed due to a
  paradigm shift in the perception of the  library&rsquo;s use of pedagogy in the services provided
  for the user. The user and her situation is in  fact the starting point for all activities and
  services, hence the facilitation of her learning  process is the basis for the provision of
  counseling and other services and activities.  Following the increasing use of problem
  orientated learning and problem based learning  pedagogy, we have applied a pedagogical
  approach to the use of information which matches  this pedagogy. This approach is based
  on the information searching processes found in  Kuhlthau [1993, 2004] and has become
  operationalized in this specific multimedia  system.<br />
  We will discuss the changing environment in the  surrounding world, at universities and
  other educational institutions which has  influence on the libraries&rsquo; role as service
  providers. The prevailing image of libraries is  that they tend to move towards becoming
  hybrid libraries, merging the physical and  virtual/digital library. We will discuss how this
  has influenced the role of libraries and which  services libraries can provide in this setting.
  We will discuss how libraries&rsquo; roles change and  focus on how they can react to rapid
  changes in technology and paradigm shifts in due  time and how they can be proactive and
  innovative. In a world where change is a  fundamental condition, we will focus on the
  adequate and required qualifications expected of  students and librarians in the new
  learning environments and in working  environments.<br />
  Participants will gain insight and inspiration  for implementing an e-learning and blended
  learning program. We will present a case study of  the distribution of the program to a
  foreign organization and how the implementation  has been organized in international
  cooperation between a Norwegian and a Danish  university library<br />
