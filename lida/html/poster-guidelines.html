  </ul>
  <h2>Preparation Tips</h2></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Your poster presentation should be educational,       scientific and balanced. Be prepared to answer or discuss topic(s) that an       attendee may have regarding your abstract.</li>
    <li>Keep your text to a minimum. Your emphasis should       be on graphics – charts, graphs, and photos. Save what you might put into text       for handouts.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Individual handouts relative to poster presentations       are popular and encouraged. </li>
    <li>The illustrations should be easy to understand,       but they need not be &quot;arty&quot;</li>
    <li>Avoid crowded and cluttered posters; they are       difficult to read and are often disregarded. </li>
    <li>Characters and figure legends should be readable from       approximately 1.8 m away</li>
    <li>Lettered material should have appropriately heavy       lettering; font size at least 20</li>
    <li>A large-character title banner, if possible,       should go across the top of the poster, as a heading for the poster, font       size at least 44. This banner should state the title (by upper case letters),       the name(s), affiliation(s) and e-mail(s) of the author(s)</li>
