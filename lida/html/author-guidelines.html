        <p>As announced earlier, traditional conference  proceedings will not be published and authors are not requested to send full  papers but only prepare a presentation. However, authors who choose to prepare  a full text manuscript will have a chance to publish their papers in the  special issue of the scholarly journal <strong>Education  for Information (EfI).</strong> Authors who decide to submit their papers for  consideration for publication in EfI are invited to submit their manuscripts to  the LIDA&rsquo;s <a href="http://lida.ffos.hr/ojs/index.php/lp/about/submissions">electronic  management system</a> by <strong>January  31, 2023</strong>. <br>
        <u>Important deadlines: </u></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Submission  of full-texts to LIDA 2023 electronic management system: </strong>January  31, 2023</li>
          <li><strong>Notification  of acceptance of full-text manuscripts for publication: </strong>1 March  2023<strong></strong></li>
          <li><strong>Submission  of final versions of full-text manuscripts: </strong>30 March 2023</li>
          <li><strong>Publication  date: </strong>June 2023</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All papers should be full-length articles between  5000-8000 words of text excluding the references.<br>
          Reviews of submitted  articles will be double-blind. The papers NOT meeting the reviewers&rsquo; standards  will not be published.<br>
          Note that the  manuscript should be uploaded as one file with tables and figures included.  This file should be a Word document.</p>
        <p><strong>PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS</strong><br>
          <strong>Organization of the paper and style of  presentation</strong><br>
          Manuscripts must be  written in English. Authors whose native language is not English are advised to  consult a professional English language editing service or a native English  speaker prior to submission.<br>
          Manuscripts should be  prepared with wide margins and double spacing throughout, including the  abstract, footnotes and references. Every page of the manuscript, including the  title page, references, tables, etc., should be numbered. However, in the text  no reference should be made to page numbers; if necessary, one may refer to  sections. Try to avoid the excessive use of italics and bold face.<br>
          Manuscripts should be  organized in the following order:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Body of  text (divided by subheadings)</li>
          <li>Acknowledgements</li>
          <li>References</li>
          <li>Tables</li>
          <li>Figure  captions</li>
          <li>Figures</li>
          <li>Headings  and subheadings should be numbered and typed on a separate line, without  indentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>Please note that at  this stage it is NOT necessary to prepare the title page!</u><br>
          All manuscripts should  be submitted as <strong>anonymous papers</strong> (e.g. remove all the author names and affiliations under the title, the author  data from document properties, all acknowledgments, etc.). <br>
          Author data are  entered under the segment <strong>Metadata</strong>.  In this segment include the following data: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>author  names and affiliation (obligatory)</li>
          <li>e-mail  addresses</li>
          <li>abstract</li>
          <li>keywords</li>
        </ul>
