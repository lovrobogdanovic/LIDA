<p>Abstract:<br />
Discusses a design methodology, &ldquo;Bonded  Design&rdquo;, developed by the authors and that utilizes the knowledge and skills of  adult designers and young users within an intergenerational team to produce  low-tech prototypes of information technology applications. The methodology  originated specifically from two intergenerational teams that each worked over  around 10 sessions to design two Web portals intended for elementary school  students to find information to support class-based project work. These teams  included alongside the adult members students from a grade-three elementary  school class (aged 8 to 9 years) in one case, and from a grade-six elementary school  class (aged 11 to 12 years) in the other case. Bonded Design involves  collaborative work while undertaking the following tasks: an initial user needs  assessment; evaluation of related technology applications; group discussion; brainstorming;  paper prototyping; and consensus building. The paper illustrates the  application of Bonded Design with reference to these two cases, and discusses  its efficacy as evaluated by the use of working versions of the two prototypes  by elementary students. Bonded Design provides a means actively to involve  young users in the technology design process from conception to prototype, and  can be accomplished with modest resources and over a period of weeks rather  than months. </p>
