                <p><strong>When information is everywhere : How should we think about  information literacy practice?</strong></p>
<p>The  fracturing of information landscapes, rapidly changing technological  environments, exponential growth in information sources and sites, the blurring  of information  boundaries, the impact of  algorithmic culture and bias present in digital   information provision and people&rsquo;s capacity to understand and mitigate  the risks of the current pandemic  present significant challenges to the lived  experience of people in everyday life.   In an age of information ubiquity, information that is relevant to  everyday life can be drawn from everywhere. The ability to <em>go on</em> requires the development and maintenance of  sustainable information literacy practices to engage  with information, access it in all its forms and then operationalise use. When  information is everywhere, information literacy </p>
                <p><strong>Annemaree Lloyd </strong>is a social science researcher who conducts research into information  literacies and contemporary information practices in formal and informal  learning connected to workplaces, community settings and in education. Her  current research program focuses on the intersection between information,  learning, and the performance of practice. She is also interested in the  connection between information literacies, social inclusion, and collaborative  learning and the nature of embodiment in information literacy practice.  Professor Lloyd pursues this research agenda working with a range of groups  including refugees, emergency services personal, nurses and with patients  suffering chronic illness, librarians, and students. Her most recent research  focuses on information practice, risk, and resilience during the COVID-19  pandemic</p>
