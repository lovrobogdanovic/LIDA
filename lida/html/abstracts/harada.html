<p>Abstract:<br />
Librarians, as key members of school  communities, have a crucial stake in contributing to the quality of teaching  that shapes student learning. They are instructional colleagues, who are  strategically positioned to assume a leadership role in curriculum reform. The  key to building instructional leadership is empowering partners to examine  their teaching <br />
practices through the lens of actual student behaviors. This knowledge is  effectively communicated when practitioners collaborate with colleagues in  implementing strategies, reflect on the results, and share them with the  professional community. Practitioner research provides powerful opportunities  for teachers and librarians to engage in this type of systematic and  intentional inquiry.<br />
As an academic researcher I have engaged both teachers and librarians in  practitioner research. We work as partners in identifying issues and questions,  determining alternative means of gathering necessary information to probe for  solutions, participating in the collection and analysis of data, determining  future classroom-library action based on <br />
findings, and deciding on effective means of disseminating gained knowledge to  the larger educational community. <br />
The overarching questions that have driven our collective investigations are:<br />
1. How do instructional partners  effectively facilitate student learning, particularly learning that embeds the  information search process? <br />
2. How do instructional partners refine their craft knowledge?<br />
3. How do they contribute to and expand the professional body of knowledge?<br />
In this presentation, I focus on five case studies of practitioner research  that were conducted in different elementary schools in Hawaii over the past decade. These studies,  ranging from a semester to a year in length, are briefly captured in terms of  contexts; specific questions addressed; data collected through field notes,  interviews, anecdotal logs, and student work samples; and findings. Questions  central to all of these studies focused on how instructional teams defined and  refined their craft knowledge based on practice and reflection. Teams studied  the effectiveness of various instructional interventions and tools used and how  assessing for learning influenced their teaching. I end by identifying  recurring themes and features that cross context boundaries and allow for  purposeful and effective planning of change.<br />
