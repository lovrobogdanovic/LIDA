<p>Abstract:<br />
This presentation is an outgrowth of a  dissertation that analyzed the mental models of students using the Internet to  complete an authentic assignment.&nbsp; The  study, undertaken to explore the Internet from the users&rsquo; perspective,  uncovered mental models students held of the Internet, the task, and of  themselves as searchers of information.&nbsp;  Many information process models were developed before the digital  library age.&nbsp; This study worked within  the framework of the Kuhlthau Information Search Process, extending it in a  digital library environment.<br />
Particular attention will be devoted to:</p>
<ul type="disc">

  <li>Sources of difficulty experienced by the students</li>
  <li>Affective aspects of the students&rsquo; experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>This session is intended for all those  interested in adolescents who use digital libraries to complete assignments.</p>
