<p>Abstract:<br />
With the exciting convergence of content, technology, and global  collaboration in this digital era, there are unprecedented potentials as well  as challenges for developing digital libraries of all kinds.&nbsp; In the case of Global Memory Net (<a href="www.memorynet.org/">www.memorynet.org/</a>), its newly developed  Interactive Multimedia Content System (tentatively called I-M-C-S) has managed  to incorporate many innovative concepts to meet the challenges of a world  digital portal.&nbsp; This paper will  articulate these challenges, including, for example, some of the following  areas:<br />
&bull; Seamless integration of all types of multimedia resources, &bull;  Digital images can not only be retrieved in traditional ways by metadata  fields, but also by cutting-edge content-based retrieval methods, &bull; Once the  desired image(s) is(are) located, associated sound, digital video, textual  annotation, as well as expanded bibliographical resources can be obtained by  simple clicks of the mouse, &bull; Available resources can by retrieved by  collection, but cross-collection (or multi-collection) search should also be possible,  &bull; Location or sponsorship of the digital resource collections should be  searchable geographically, &bull; Multilingual presentation as well as retrieval  should be possible, &bull; While universal access is the goal, the world users  should be possible to contribute as well.<br />
In the past year, Global Memory Net has made considerable progress,  and this paper will be able to demonstrate in real time these new developments,  particularly since 2004.</p>
