  Through the digitization of cultural artifacts and circulation of cultural information in large 
  technical systems, a critical mass of cultural and heritage materials is becoming available 
  on the Web. These popular and scholarly historical resources need to be better 
  understood by creators of digital content. In this workshop, the components of the History 
  Web will be examined from the perspectives of creation and use.<br />
  <br />
  The workshop will have the following components:<br />
</p>
<ol>
  <li>n overview of policies for digitization in the European context and the role of digital 
    content as living history and record of multicultural societies.<br />
  </li>
  <li> A survey of different genres of web-based histories and their significance for historical 
    research.<br />
  </li>
  <li> Creating your own project for the History Web:<br />
    <blockquote>How to structure a history website<br />
    Preparing technology specifications for a history web project<br />
    Preparing content<br />
    Publicizing your website, building an audience<br />
    Supporting different modes of interactivity<br />
    Legal and ethical issues for content creation and use</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li> Digital history &ndash; practical implications for society, institutions, researchers and the public.<br />
  </li>
</ol>
<p>This workshop will be useful to all those who plan to present historical collections on the Web, 
including administrators and developers of archival and museum displays as well as historians 
and other researchers. Participants will be encouraged to discuss their own historical projects and 
history sites of their own institutions.<br />
