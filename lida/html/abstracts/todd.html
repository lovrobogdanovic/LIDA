<p>Abstract:<br />
The development of large and complex print  and digital information collections in elementary, middle and high schools has  major implications not only for the technology and resource infrastructure of  the school library, but increasingly, on how instruction and meaningful  learning can be enabled through the school library.&nbsp; This presentation presents the findings of  research undertaken by Todd&nbsp; and&nbsp; Kuhlthau from 2003 to 2005 that focuses on  the nature of learning in digital age schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;  This research sought to identify how students&rsquo; knowledge of a curriculum  topic changed as they made use of diverse digital and print information  sources, and&nbsp; lead by collaborating teams  of school librarians and classroom teachers.&nbsp;  In order to examine the change  in a students&rsquo; knowledge of a topic, the following specific research questions  were investigated through quantitative and qualitative data collection  approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What changes, if any, are evident in students&rsquo; knowledge of a curriculum  related topic, as they proceed through the stages of a collaborative inquiry  project, making use of diverse print and digital sources?</li>
  <li>What changes, if any, are shown in the students&rsquo; feelings as they proceed  through the stages of a collaborative inquiry project?</li>
  <li>How does the students&rsquo; study approach influence knowledge construction of  a curriculum topic in collaborative inquiry projects? </li>
  <li>What interactions exist between knowledge construction, feelings, and  study approach, and what are some of the explanations for these interactions?</li>
</ul>
<p>The project,  funded by the Institute for Museums and Library Services (USA) involved 10  school librarian-classroom teacher teams working with&nbsp; 574 students in Grades 6 &ndash; 13, and in a range  of curriculum areas &ndash; chemistry, biology, humanities, and social science.&nbsp; A series of quantitative and qualitative data collection instruments we employed at  the initiation, midpoint and completion of the projects.&nbsp; Students utilized a range of print and  digital information services and products, and received instruction during the  process.&nbsp; The study identifies  some key findings about students&rsquo; search processes and their process of  building new knowledge.&nbsp; These will be  documented in this presentation.&nbsp; The  research showed that through inquiry projects: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>students&rsquo; initial knowledge       underwent a significant conceptual change with distinctive patterns shown       in their knowledge construction;</li>
  <li>some students learned topical       content in deep ways, shown in complex and coherent knowledge structures;</li>
  <li>students generally became more       skillful and confident as information seekers;</li>
  <li>students became increasingly       engaged, interested and reflective during their learning process, and saw       information seeking as a constructive process of building both deep       knowledge and deep understanding</li>
  <li>students became more critically       aware of the broad variety of sources and their different purposes;</li>
  <li>students gained practical skills       in independent information seeking, moving from fact finding to       information analysis and synthesis;</li>
  <li>students showed increasing       awareness of the varied quality of information, as well as of information       as a problematic and often contradictory. </li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude,&nbsp; this presentation will some of&nbsp; the implications of this research for the  ongoing development of digital age school libraries in relation to three  components:&nbsp; informational &ndash; the  information technology and resources infrastructure; transformational &ndash; the  nature of effective instruction to enable students to build new knowledge; and  formational &ndash; meeting and measuring learning outcomes.&nbsp; </p>
