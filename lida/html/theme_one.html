                <p><strong>Part  I: Digital  Curation and Preservation - Current Trends and Research.</strong><br />
                Program chair: <a href="http://moulaison.net">Heather Lea Moulaison, iSchool, University of  Missouri, US</a></p>
                <p>Preserving digital content for future  access and use represents a major theoretical and practical challenge for  digital libraries. Without careful and informed actions, the long-term  preservation of digital content cannot be ensured. Digital curation of  electronic content requires the development of new kinds of technological  expertise and partnerships, and allows for new ways of thinking about  stakeholders and access.</p>
                <p>As study into the stewardship of digital  content moves forward, opportunities and challenges can be identified and  assessed. Research initiatives, reflective assessments of practice, and other  forms of scholarly investigations can inform future directions in digital  curation practice, and ultimately, in access. </p>
                <p>Contributions (types described below) are  invited covering the following topics:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Advances in activities or       technologies needed for digital curation and digital preservation</li>
                  <li>Developments in systems       and networks supporting long-term preservation and access </li>
                  <li>Standards-based advances       in digital curation and preservation</li>
                  <li>Cost models and long-term       funding considerations</li>
                  <li>Risk management in digital       curation</li>
                  <li>Preservation of and access       to oral and other non-text content</li>
                  <li>Evaluation of systems,       practices, or approaches used in digital curation</li>
                  <li>Stakeholders       (contributors, users, etc.) and the use and users of preserved digital       content</li>
                  <li>Implementation of digital       initiatives, systems, projects, etc., supporting long-term access to       digital content, including international and intercultural initiatives</li>
                  <li>Education and training for       the long-term management of digital collections</li>
                  <li>Discussion about general       issues: How are we to understand digital curation in its own right? How       are we to respond in digital libraries? What are the opportunities and       challenges?</li>
