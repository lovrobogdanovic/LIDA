<p>Abstract:<br />
This paper reports the results of a study that examined   Arabic-speaking children&rsquo;s interaction with the International Children&rsquo;s Digital   Library (ICDL). Ten children ages 6-10 who live in Alexandria, Egypt participated in this   study. Children&rsquo;s understanding of the ICDL system design representations   (icons, search and browse features, buttons, and visual cues) and their meanings   was grounded in &ldquo;design representations&rdquo; and &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; rather than in   internationalization and localization. Findings revealed that, overall, the ICDL   system design representations and their meanings were appropriate for older   children but inappropriate for younger ones. Both younger and older children did   not recognize the search and browse features from the ICDL default interface,   with the exception of the Keyword search option that only older children   understood its meaning. Implications are made for system design improvements   that are supportive of children&rsquo;s needs. </p>
