<strong>
Purpose</strong><br>

                        <br>

                        The general aim of the annual conference

                        and course Libraries in the Digital Age (LIDA),

                        started in 2000, is to address the

                        changing and challenging environment for

                        libraries and information systems and

                        services in the digital world, with an

                        emphasis on examining contemporary

                        problems, advances and solutions. Each

                        year a different and hot theme is

                        addressed, divided in two parts; the

                        first part covers research and

                        development and the second part addresses

                        advances in applications and practice.

                        LIDA seeks to bring together researchers,

                        practitioners, and developers in a forum

                        for personal exchanges, discussions, and

                        learning, made easier by being held in

                        memorable locations.<br>

                        <strong>Rationale</strong><br>

                        <br>

                        Libraries and information systems

                        everywhere are increasingly and greatly

                        affected in all of their functions by the

                        rapid evolution of the digital age. While

                        the growing World Wide Web, and the

                        Internet in general, greatly enhances

                        access to a variety of information

                        resources, it also provides for many new

                        and complex challenges and problems for

                        libraries and information systems, as

                        well as for their creators and users. The

                        critical, main issue is ensuring an

                        effective and efficient flow of

                        information from the generators to users

                        of information in the digital

                        environment, and by using electronic

                        resources, services, and networks. This

                        is a complex communication chain with

                        libraries and information systems playing

                        an important, even critical role. This

                        role brings also a number of new

                        requirements. Due to the complexity of

                        these requirements it is no longer

                        possible for librarians and information

                        specialists to act without being

                        continuously abreast of new methods and

                        techniques and without being informed

                        regularly about new trends and approaches.

                        In other words, for librarians and

                        information professionals the digital age

                        also brings a need for a constant update

                        of their professional knowledge and

                        competencies.<br>

                        <br>

                        The course is oriented toward

                        professionals and researchers in

                        librarianship, information science, and

                        informatics, as well as from other

                        disciplines interested in this topic. In

                        particular, the course will be useful for

                        practicing librarians and information

                        scientists, for students of library and

                        information science, and for system

                        administrators, system operators, web

                        page managers, and related personnel in

                        library and information systems.<br>
