<p>Abstract:<br />
Digital Libraries, and other IR systems of  all kinds, are developing at a rapid pace, providing greater access to  information previously unavailable and unfamiliar to the general public. They  are being constructed to provide access, in a variety of forms, to information  that was previously available from traditional physical libraries. However, in  contrast to physical libraries, manned by human help, Digital Libraries provide  their users with automated Help assistance. This talk will present findings  from an ongoing study designed to evaluate how effective these computerized  Help systems are for novice users among the general public. Previous research  within this problem area has found that although most of the research subjects  believed automated Help systems to be important, they used them infrequently.  Reasons for not using automated help assistance in two digital libraries are  discussed in this talk, along with points of strength and weakness in currently  available systems. Results of a comparison between types and forms of Help  utilized by users engaged in <strong>human</strong> interaction with Help experts  compared to users who relied on automated Help alone are discussed. The talk  concludes with some proposed design principles for the improvement of purely  automated Help systems. </p>
