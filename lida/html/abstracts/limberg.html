<p>Abstract:<br />
The purpose  of this paper is to present and discuss an analysis of research findings from  three major research projects conducted during the last decade. The topic of  research is information seeking and learning with a particular interest  directed to how information and communication technologies shape learning and  teching experiences. The research was set in school contexts, from elementary  to upper secondary level, and had dual points of departure, adopting either a  learning (students) or a teaching (teachers and librarians) perspective. The  major theoretical framework for these studies was formed by two perspectives on  learning; firstly a phenomenographic approach aiming at describing variation of  ways of experiencing information seeking and information literacy; secondly, a  socio-cultural perspective, viewing information seeking and learning as participation  in a socialisation exercise set in the discursive practice of school. One  conclusive finding was that the quality of students&rsquo; information seeking and  use closely interacts with the quality of their learning outcomes. Findings  further indicate a surprising gap between teachers&rsquo; views of the content of  information literacy education and their views of assessment criteria as  regards the quality of students&rsquo; work. Together these research projects reveal  a major difference between young peoples&rsquo; views of information seeking and  teachers&rsquo;s and librarians&rsquo; views of the goals and means for information  seeking. The paper will discuss various implications of these findings, for  teaching and learning information literacy.</p>
