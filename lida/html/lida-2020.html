<p align="left" style="line-height:21px">The first LIDA conference in 2000 was themed “Positioning Libraries on the Internet and using Internet in Libraries”.  We have come along way!  The LIDA journey has embraced technological developments, examined ethical, legal and economic issues of the digital age, explored system and service design for digital libraries, examined education and competencies for LIS professionals, explored social, cultural and organizational dynamics as they impact the development of libraries, and sought to understand the power and impact of digital networks.  Through this journey, LIDA has contributed to the development of theories, frameworks and methods for research, and provided insights for innovations in libraries and information agencies. </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height:21px">Central to this scholarly journey has been people. Today we are witnessing a shifting focus from the technology of the digital, to a focus on the humanity of the digital.  Who are we in the digital landscape?  How, if at all, are our identities being shaped and transformed in this landscape, and how are these shapings and transformations impacting the ongoing development of libraries in the digital age?   Who is transforming what, and what is transforming who? </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height:21px">The construct of identity and how individuals and groups come to define themselves is complex.  Understanding and addressing this complexity is the theme of LIDA 2020.  As demonstrated in its 20-year history, LIDA seeks to provide an interdisciplinary platform for researchers, LIS practitioners and educators to present conceptualizations, empirical research, trends, innovations, challenges in relation to Identity, particularly in the context of the ongoing development of library and information agencies, systems and services. </p>
