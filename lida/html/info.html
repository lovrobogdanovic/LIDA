<p> LIDA  2008 sessions will take place at the <strong>Inter-University</strong><strong> Center - IUC (Don Frana Bulica 4,  outside the Old Town). </strong>It is easily reachable from your hotel, either on foot or by  public transport. Please ask at your hotel about local buses' schedules and  rates.
