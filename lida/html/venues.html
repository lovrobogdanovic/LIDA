<p><strong>The City of Osijek</strong> <br>
Osijek  is the 4th largest city in Croatia, with total population of ca 100,000  inhabitants. It is a city located inland in the eastern part of the country on  the right bank of the river Drava. Osijek, as a city, finds its foundations in  the ancient times when Romans established colonies in Croatia. Various cultures  have left their mark in this city, since Osijek is also strategically  well-positioned, with  neighbouring  countries like Hungary and Serbia within driving distance. Nearby,  there is a must-see Nature Park Kopački rit,  also called the European Amazon, which was declared a part of the  Mura-Drava-Danube Biosphere Reserve under UNESCO. The city is affiliated with  many notable persons such as two Nobel Prize winners (Lavoslav Ružička and  Vladimir Prelog), Branko Lustig, a Hollywood producer and winner of two Oscars  (for Schindler's List and Gladiator) and Julije Knifer, an abstract painter.  The city is increasingly attracting young populations thanks to its prestigious  university and a growing software development industry. Osijek is also known as  a gastronomical capital of Croatia, offering diverse specialties such as fresh  fish, game, organic veggies, and delicious artisanal  pastry, made in traditional ways. The city  has a growing craft beer scene, and issurrounded by a traditionally well known  wine making region. The city is considered as a local capital of bicycling and  every June it hosts the Pannonian Challenge, an extreme sport and music  festival.&nbsp;</p>
