<p>Abstract:<br />
Much of the useful information in public  health (PH) is considered grey literature, i.e. literature that is not  available through traditional, commercial pathways. The diversity and  non-traditional format of this information makes it difficult to locate and  collect, and also a rich domain with high potential payoff for the development  of a Digital Library. Under funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, we  set forth to improve access to PH grey literature reports through established  natural language processing (NLP) techniques. First, we needed to establish a  model-based metadata schema for automatically analyzing and representing the PH  grey literature. To accomplish this, we analyzed a corpus of grey literature  from PH websites to determine a candidate set of metadata elements, followed by  review by PH professionals who prioritized the elements for NLP extraction into  a metadata record. The automatic NLP extraction technology was used to populate  this schema for a collection of PH reports and evaluated by experts. Current  research, funded by NLM, is building on these early successful results for the  construction of a fuller digital library and an evaluation of its contribution  to the work practices of PH professionals in county health departments in New York and Seattle.</p>
