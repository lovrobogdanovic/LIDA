                <p><strong>Part  II: Use Studies, Education &amp; Training for Digital Library Collections.</strong><br />
                  Program chair: <a href="https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/school/people/seadle">Michael Seadle, Institute of Library and Information  Science, Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Germany</a></p>
                <p>Digital collections have a user population that is independent of time  zone, physical location and language. It no longer suffices to design the interface,  the organization, and the content around the expectations of local users. Usage  and user studies need to take place in a digital environment and to address  cultural and linguistic issues explicitly. Developing and using tools for  online user and usage studies is part of a modern evaluation program, and  involves new approaches for scholarly research. </p>
                <p>Part of the education and training for students and staff should give  them new tools for working with modern digital content. Distant reading or text  mining is a key element for how future scholars will access content across  large ranges of machine-readable text. Machine intelligence and semantic web  technologies play a role as digital collections rely increasingly on complex  search algorithms rather than simple indexes. Research integrity discovery and  evaluation also plays a role in maintaining the quality of scholarly content  and needs to be part of contemporary training. Organizations need new  approaches to prepare people for content discovery and for reading that were  previously not possible.</p>
<p>Contributions (types described below) are invited covering the  following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Usage  studies based on digital sources, including log file analysis, social media,  and bibliometric / infometric source analysis</li>
  <li>Language  sensitive and culturally sensitive user studies that include online testing,  videoconference-based interviews and/or focus groups</li>
  <li>Statistical  and/or qualitative analyses of digital collections</li>
  <li>Training  and curriculum plans to teach text mining, semantic web, triple store  databases, and tools using machine intelligence</li>
  <li>Research  integrity discovery and evaluation tools and training</li>
  <li>Forms  of training and education that help people engage actively with the latest developments  in information science</li>
  <li>Discussion  about general issues: How can we better understand users and uses of digital  collections? How do we educate and teach for digital collections? </li>
</ul>
